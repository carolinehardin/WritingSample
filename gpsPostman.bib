@article{Chen1999,
abstract = {This paper proposes a theoretical model of wayfinding that can be used to guide the design of navigational aiding in virtual environments. Based on an evaluation of wayfinding studies in natural environments, this model divides the wayfinding process into three main subprocesses: cognitive mapping, wayfinding plan development, and physical movement or navigation through an environment. While this general subdivision has been proposed before, the current model further delineates the wayfinding process, including the distinct influences of spatial information, spatial orientation, and spatial knowledge. The influences of experience, abilities, search strategies, motivation, and environmental layout on the wayfinding process are also considered. With this specification of the wayfinding process, a taxonomy of navigational tools is then proposed that can be used to systematically aid the specified wayfinding subprocesses. If effectively applied to the design of a virtual environment, the use of such tools sho...},

@article{Gardony2013,
abstract = {Abstract Research has demonstrated navigational aids impair spatial memory, but has not considered important spatial cognitive concepts. For example, impairment may stem from spatial perspective switches between route-based aids and survey-based memory assessments. Further, the verbal format of aid instructions may selectively interfere with verbal working memory (VWM). To address these potential explanations, participants navigated desktop virtual environments in a goal-directed manner. In each within-participants condition, participants either navigated with a verbal or tonal aid that presented mixed spatial perspective instructions or without aid. Both aids yielded slight navigational advantages and steep spatial memory costs despite their mixed perspective instructions. The equivalent impairment between information formats suggests navigational aids impair spatial memory by dividing attention rather than selective interference of VWM.
